## Social Sciences $\neq$ History

- The Question **historians** try to answer

    - **What actually happened**

- The Question **social scientists** try to answer

    - **Why do something happen / exist**

-  $Outputs / Outcomes$ $\leftarrow$ $Inputs$

- Social Research = $Input \rightarrow Mechanism \rightarrow Output$

## Real Sciences Way
- 1. Do some initial experiment (mixture of ingredients $\rightarrow$ speed of chemical reaction)
- 2. Change your inputs (add an extra ingredient) $\rightarrow$
- 3. Look if your output changed

## Can we do it in social sciences?

- \pause sometimes

    - social scientists cannot "change the input"

- What they usually do?

    - look for a proper comparison unit / group

## Some examples

- Terrorist attacks 
    
    - (France, 15 VS France, 21)
    
    - (Germany, 21 VS France, 21)
    
## Social Science Research Question

- **Why does something happen in one places, but not in the others?**

- Yes or No:
    
    - Why do some nations become rich, while other stay poor?
    - Why do some nations make war on each other?
    - Why did Donald Trump / Barack Obama win the election?
    - Lack a group for comparison. \pause Alternative?
    - Why did Russia fail to democratize?
    - Alternative?

## A social sciences way of doing research

1. Outcome of Interest: *Intensity of Civil Conflicts*
2. List of potential explanations:

    - Lack of Democracy -> Grievances -> Conflict
    - 

- Since "Arab Spring" authoritarian governments learned several lessons
- **Lesson**: do not be afraid of them, but use social media as a tool of regime durability:
    * Monitor activity of dissidents (protesting plans) 
    * General public preferences (e.g., online petitions)
    * Shape the contours of public discussion (see a review in [Gunitsky,2015]())
- *Online pro-government commentators*, or *"trolls"* - persons who are paid to support some politician

## Focus on Identification and Tactics


## Potential strategies, target groups, style of messaging
<!-- No conventional wisdom on what are these strategies that trolls employ, I think they can be at least five and this is not mutually exclusive --> 
- **Promote Pro-government Agenda**: Troll: *“Russia's reunion with Crimea is good”*, User: *“Well... yeah, why not”*

- **Distract Activists from Anti-government conversations**: Users: *“We cannot buy olives because of the Crimea sanctions!”*, Trolls: *“But in the next couple of years, there will be massive olive production in Crimea"*, Users: *“Is it that fast?”*

- **Project Popularity**: *"Putin is the only hope", "Who if not Putin"* 

- **Project Strength**: *"We see all of you and know where you are"*

- **Imitate Anti-government Extremism**: Trolls: *“Let's bribe the military and assault the Kremlin”*, *“Let's also kill chechens because we hate them”.*
