## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
set.seed(1234)
conflict <- rnorm(30,10)
democracy <- rnorm(30,10)
mountains <- conflict + runif(30,0,3)
d <- cbind(conflict,democracy, mountains ) %>% data.table()
```


```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(d, aes(y = conflict, x = democracy)) + geom_point(col = 'blue') +theme_bw() +ylab("Intensity of Civil Conflict")
p2 <- ggplot(d, aes(y = conflict, x = democracy)) + geom_point(col = 'blue') +theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se = F) +ylab("Intensity of Civil Conflict")
p3 <- ggplot(d, aes(y = conflict, x = mountains)) + geom_point(col = 'red') +theme_bw() +ylab("Intensity of Civil Conflict")
p4 <- ggplot(d, aes(y = conflict, x = mountains)) + geom_point(col = 'red') +theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se = F, col = "red") + ylab("Intensity of Civil Conflict")


ggsave(plot = p1, 'p1.png', width = 14 ,height = 8, units = "cm")
ggsave(plot = p2, 'p2.png', width = 14 ,height = 8, units = "cm")
ggsave(plot = p3, 'p3.png', width = 14 ,height = 8, units = "cm")
ggsave(plot = p4, 'p4.png', width = 14 ,height = 8, units = "cm")

```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
